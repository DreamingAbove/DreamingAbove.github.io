        <ul>
            <li>To use the App only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms</li>
            <li>Not to create false or misleading Hangs</li>

        <h2>3. Location-Based Services</h2>
        <p>The App provides location-based services that require access to your device's location. By using the App, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>

            <li>Location accuracy depends on your device's GPS and network connectivity</li>
            <li>The App uses Apple MapKit for map services, which is subject to Apple's terms and conditions</li>
            <li>You are responsible for your own safety when meeting others at Hang locations</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Important Safety Notice:</b> Always meet in public places and use your best judgment when attending Hangs. The App does not verify the identity or intentions of users, and you attend Hangs at your own risk.</p>

            <li>The accuracy of the location and description of your Hang</li>
            <li>Ensuring the location is appropriate and safe for meetups</li>
            <li>Ending your Hang if you need to leave or if the situation becomes unsafe</li>
            <li>Respecting the privacy of attendees</li>
