        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>How do I create a Hang?</h3>
        <p>Tap the "Start a Hang" button on the main screen. The app will use your current location (or you can edit the place label). Choose visibility (Friends or Private), add an optional description, and tap "Go live."</p>

        <h3>How long do Hangs last?</h3>
        <p>Hangs have a default visibility window of 30 minutes from creation. After 30 minutes, the Hang automatically disappears from discovery, even if you're still there. You can also end a Hang early at any time.</p>

        <h3>Who can see my Hangs?</h3>
        <p>You can choose to make Hangs visible to all your friends or create private Hangs with specific invitees. Hangs are never public or visible to strangers.</p>

        <h3>How do I add friends?</h3>
        <p>Search for users by username or share your profile link. Send a friend request, and once both users accept, you become friends and can see each other's Hangs.</p>

        <h3>What are presence states?</h3>
        <p>When viewing a Hang, you can mark yourself as "On my way" or "I am here" to let the host and other attendees know your status. These states are visible to everyone viewing the Hang.</p>

        <h3>How do I block or report a user?</h3>
        <p>You can block or report users from their profile or from any Hang detail screen. Blocked users cannot see your Hangs or send you friend requests.</p>

        <h3>Is my location safe?</h3>
        <p>We never create Hangs at precise home addresses for public visibility. Hangs are only visible to your friends or private invitees. Always meet in public places and use your best judgment.</p>

        <h3>Can I change my profile information?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can update your display name, username, avatar, and bio through the app settings at any time.</p>

        <h3>What authentication methods are supported?</h3>
        <p>You can sign in with Apple, Google, or Facebook. These are the only authentication methods available in the MVP version.</p>

        <h3>How do I delete my account?</h3>
        <p>You can delete your account through the app settings. This will remove your profile, all Hangs, and friend relationships.</p>

        <h2>Feedback</h2>
        <p>We welcome your feedback as it helps us improve Let's Hang. Feel free to send us your suggestions, feature requests, and comments.</p>

        <h2>Safety Concerns</h2>
